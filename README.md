# 👋 Hi, I'm Marcel

I'm working on data-driven simulations, time series models, and agent-based systems — mostly in Python, Julia, and C++.  
I enjoy building tools and pipelines for real-world data problems, particularly in physics and finance.  
I'm also open to business collaboration, research projects, and meaningful non-profit work that involves data and modeling.

## 🧠 Interests
- Data pipelines & backend systems  
- Time series reconstruction & forecasting  
- Agent-based modeling  
- Machine learning in financial applications
